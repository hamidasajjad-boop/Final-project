#Unit-3 Class design.

3.1 Data Abstraction- simplify, easier.  - retrival.

Object oriented world - instance varaibles ,methods, constructors. 
-concept modularity. - breaking tasks into simpler and small tasks.
-no repetition and reduce redunduncy.

prodecural abstraction is for methods/behaviours.

Encapsulation - medicine - pill 
- modularity + combine 


3.3 anatomy of a class - 

i have attributes methods and constructors and i create objects to use them differently. 

how to create objects syntax:
classname objectname = new constructor. - syntax. 

data encapsulation - we are able to seperate our data thorugh access specifers. public private.



5 marks (most easy to get)
1. declaration of the class
-syntax: public class classname
{
}

2.Attributes 1 mark. instance varaible 
they are not local varaible.
-private datatype varaiblename

3.Constructors
syntax - public classaname(parameters)
{

}
how to know what parameter to write
-look at the attributes
-datatype is always mentioned in the question
-confirm by looking at the object.

4.Method signature 
syntax - public void/returning data type methodname(parameters)
{

}
parameters:
-look at the examples method is called.
